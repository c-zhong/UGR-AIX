    "## 2. Case1 Data scientist: Boolean Rule and Logistic Rule Regression models\n",
    "In evaluating a machine learning model for deployment, a data scientist would ideally like to understand the behavior of the model as a whole, not just in specific instances (e.g. specific loan applicants). This is especially true in regulated industries such as banking where higher standards of explainability may be required. For example, the data scientist may have to present the model to: 1) technical and business managers for review before deployment, 2) a lending expert to compare the model to the expert's knowledge, or 3) a regulator to check for compliance. Furthermore, it is common for a model to be deployed in a different geography than the one it was trained on. A global view of the model may uncover problems with overfitting and poor generalization to other geographies before deployment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Directly interpretable models can provide such global understanding because they have a sufficiently simple form for their workings to be transparent. Below we present two directly interpretable models in the form of a [Boolean rule (BR)](#BRCG) and a [logistic rule regression (LogRR)](#LogRR) model. The former is produced by the Boolean Rule Column Generation (BRCG) algorithm while the latter is a generalized linear rule model (GLRM), both implemented in AIX360. While both models are interpretable, they provide different trade-offs between model simplicity and accuracy in predicting loan repayment. BRCG yields a very simple set of rules that has reasonable accuracy. LogRR achieves higher accuracy, higher even than some uninterpretable models, while retaining the form of a linear model. Its interpretation is enhanced by [plots as demonstrated below](#visualize)."

The setting `custom_preprocessing=nan_preprocessing` converts special values in the data (coded as negative integers) to `np.nan`, which can be handled properly by BRCG and LogRR, as opposed to replacing them with zeros or mean values. The data is then split into training and test sets using a fixed random seed."

    "### 2.2. Run Boolean Rule Column Generation (BRCG)\n",
    "First we consider BRCG, which is designed to produce a very simple OR-of-ANDs rule (known more formally as disjunctive normal form, DNF) or alternatively an AND-of-ORs rule (conjunctive normal form, CNF) to predict whether an applicant will repay the loan on time (Y = 1). For a binary classification problem such as we have here, a DNF rule is equivalent to a *rule set*, where AND clauses in the DNF correspond to individual rules in the rule set. Furthermore, it can be shown that a CNF rule for Y = 1 is equivalent to a DNF rule for Y = 0 [[1]](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7738856). BRCG is distinguished by its use of the optimization technique of column generation to search the space of possible clauses, which is exponential in size. To learn more about column generation, please see our NeurIPS paper [[2]](http://papers.nips.cc/paper/7716-boolean-decision-rules-via-column-generation). \n",
    "\n",
    "For this dataset, we find that a CNF rule for Y = 1 (i.e. a DNF for Y = 0, enabled by setting `CNF=True`) is slightly better than a DNF rule for Y = 1. The model complexity parameters `lambda0` and `lambda1` penalize the number of clauses in the rule and the number of conditions in each clause. We use the default values of 1e-3 for `lambda0` and `lambda1` (decreasing them did not increase accuracy here) and leave other parameters at their defaults as well. The model is then trained, evaluated, and printed."

Specifically, LogRR fits a logistic regression model using rule-based features, where column generation is again used to generate promising candidates from the space of all possible rules. Here we are also including unbinarized ordinal features (`useOrd=True`) in addition to rules. Similar to BRCG, the complexity parameters `lambda0`, `lambda1` penalize the number of rules included in the model and the number of conditions in each rule. the The values for `lambda0`, `lambda1` below strike a good balance between accuracy and model complexity, based on our published experience with the FICO HELOC dataset [[3]](http://proceedings.mlr.press/v97/wei19a.html)."

    "The test accuracy of LogRR is significantly better than that of BRCG and even better than the neural network in the [Loan Officer](#c2) and [Customer](#contrastive) sections. The LogRR model remains directly interpretable as it is a logistic regression model that uses the 36 rule-based and ordinal features shown above (in addition to an intercept term). Rules are distinguished by having one or more conditions on feature values (e.g. AverageMInFile <= 52.0) while ordinal features are marked by just the feature name without conditions (e.g. ExternalRiskEstimate). Being a linear model, feature importance is naturally given by the model coefficients and thus the list is sorted in order of decreasing coefficient magnitude. The list can be truncated if the user wishes to display fewer features.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the rules in this LogRR model happen to all be single conditions on individual features, the model contains no interactions between features. It is therefore a kind of [generalized additive model (GAM)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalized_additive_model), i.e. a sum of functions of individual features, where these functions are themselves sums of step function components from rules and linear components from unbinarized ordinal features. Thus a better way to visualize the model is by plotting the univariate functions that make up the GAM, as we do next."

    "We use the `visualize()` method of `LogisticRuleRegression` to plot the functions in the GAM that corresponds to the LogRR model (more generally, `visualize()` plots the GAM part of a LogRR model, excluding higher-degree rules). The plots show the sizes and shapes of the model's dependences on individual features. These can then be compared to a lending expert's knowledge. In the present case, all plots indicate that the model behaves as we would expect with some interesting nuances. \n",

    "## Case 3. Loan Officer: Prototypical explanations for HELOC use case\n",
    "\n",
    "We now show how to generate explanations in the form of selecting prototypical or similar user profiles to an applicant in question that a bank employee such as a loan officer may be interested in. This may help the employee understand the decision of an applicant's HELOC application being accepted or rejected in the context of other similar applications. Note that the selected prototypical applications are profiles that are part of the training set that has been used to train an AI model that predicts good or bad i.e. approved or rejected for these applications. In fact, the method used in this notebook can work even if we are given not just one but a set of user profiles for which we want to find similar profiles from a training dataset. Additionally, the method computes weights for each prototype showcasing its similarity to the user(s) in question.\n",
    "\n",
    "The prototypical explanations in AIX360 are obtained using the Protodash algorithm developed in the following work: [ProtoDash: Fast Interpretable Prototype Selection](https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.01212)\n",
    "\n",
    "We now provide a brief overview of the method. The method takes as input a datapoint (or group of datapoints) that we want to explain with respect to instances in a training set belonging to the same feature space. The method then tries to minimize the maximum mean discrepancy (MMD metric) between the datapoints we want to explain and a prespecified number of instances from the training set that it will select. In other words, it will try to select training instances that have the same distribution as the datapoints we want to explain. The method does greedy selection and has quality guarantees with it also returning importance weights for the chosen prototypical training instances indicative of how similar/representative they are.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we will see two examples of obtaining prototypes, one for a user whose HELOC application was approved and another for a user whose HELOC application was rejected. In each case, we showcase the top five prototypes from the training data along with how similar the feature values were for these prototypes.\n",
    "\n",
    "[Example 1. Obtaining similar samples as explanations for a HELOC applicant predicted as \"Good\"](#good)<br>\n",
    "[Example 2. Obtaining similar samples as explanations for a HELOC applicant predicted as \"Bad\"](#bad)<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "###### Why Protodash?\n",
    "Before we showcase the two examples we provide some motivation for using this method. The method selects applications from the training set that are similar in different ways to the user application we want to explain. For example, a users loan may be rejected justifiably because the number of satisfactory trades he performed were low similar to another rejected user, or because his/her debts were too high similar to a different rejected user. Either of these reasons in isolation may be sufficient for rejection and the method is able to surface a variety of such reasons through the selected prototypes. This is not the case using standard nearest neighbor techniques which use metrics such as euclidean distance, cosine similarity amongst others, where one might get the same type of explanation (i.e. applications with only low number of satisfactory trades). Protodash thus is able to provide a much more well rounded and comprehensive view of why the decision for the applicant may be justifiable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another benefit of the method is that — since it does distribution matching between the user/users in question and those available in the training set — it could, in principle, be applied also in non-iid settings such as for time series data. Other approaches which find similar profiles using standard distance measures (viz. euclidean, cosine) do not have this property. Additionally, we can also highlight important features for the different prototypes that made them similar to the user/users in question.\n"

    "Here again, the above table depicts the five closest user profiles to the chosen applicant. Based on importance weight outputted by the method we see that the prototype under column zero is the most representative user profile by far. This is (intuitively) confirmed from the feature similarity table above where 10 features out of 23 of this prototype are highly similar (>0.9) to that of the user we want to explain. Also the bank employee can see that the applicant belongs to a group of rejected applicants with similar deliquency behavior. Realizing that the user also poses similar risk as these other applicants whose loan was rejected, the employee takes the more conservative decision of rejecting the users application as well."

    "We now demonstrate how to compute contrastive explanations using AIX360 and how such explanations can help home owners understand the decisions made by AI models that approve or reject their HELOC applications. \n",
    "\n",
    "Typically, home owners would like to understand why they do not qualify for a line of credit and if so what changes in their application would qualify them. On the other hand, if they qualified, they might want to know what factors led to the approval of their application. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this context, contrastive explanations provide information to applicants about what minimal changes to their profile would have changed the decision of the AI model from reject to accept or vice-versa (_pertinent negatives_). For example, increasing the number of satisfactory trades to a certain value may have led to the acceptance of the application everything else being the same. \n",
    "\n",
    "The method presented here also highlights a minimal set of features and their values that would still maintain the original decision (_pertinent positives_). For example, for an applicant whose HELOC application was approved, the \n",
    "explanation may say that even if the number of satisfactory trades was reduced to a lower number, the loan would have still gotten through.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, organizations (Banks, financial institutions, etc.) would like to understand trends in the behavior of their AI models in approving loan applications, which could be done by studying contrastive explanations for individuals whose loans were either accepted or rejected. Looking at the aggregate statistics of pertinent positives for approved applicants the organization can get insight into what minimal set of features and their values play an important role in acceptances. While studying the aggregate statistics of pertinent negatives the organization can get insight into features that could change the status of rejected applicants and potentially uncover ways that an applicant may game the system by changing potentially non-important features that could alter the models outcome. \n",
    "\n",
    "The contrastive explanations in AIX360 are implemented using the algorithm developed in the following work:\n",
    "###### [Explanations based on the Missing: Towards Contrastive Explanations with Pertinent Negatives](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.07623)\n",
    "\n",
    "We now provide a brief overview of the method. As mentioned above the algorithm outputs a contrastive explanation which consists of two parts: a) pertinent negatives (PNs) and b) pertinent positives (PPs). PNs identify a minimal set of features which if altered would change the classification of the original input. For example, in the loan case if a person's credit score is increased their loan application status may change from reject to accept. The manner in which the method accomplishes this is by optimizing a change in the prediction probability loss while enforcing an elastic norm constraint that results in minimal change of features and their values. Optionally, an auto-encoder may also be used to force these minimal changes to produce realistic PNs. PPs on the other hand identify a minimal set of features and their values that are sufficient to yield the original input's classification. For example, an individual's loan may still be accepted if the salary was 50K as opposed to 100K. Here again we have an elastic norm term so that the amount of information needed is minimal, however, the first loss term in this case tries to make the original input's class to be the winning class. For a more in-depth discussion, please refer to the above work.\n",
